# Solar System Data Scraper

This project is a web scraper that extracts planetary data from the [Royal Museums Greenwich website](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/solar-system-data) and saves it as a CSV file using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

## Features
- Scrapes planetary data including name, sidereal period, perihelion, aphelion, and inclination.
- Stores the extracted data in a structured Pandas DataFrame.
- Saves the data to a CSV file (`solar_system_data.csv`).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping)
- **Requests** (for HTTP requests)
- **Pandas** (for data processing and CSV export)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
```

## Usage
Run the script to scrape the latest solar system data and save it to a CSV file:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

After execution, the `solar_system_data.csv` file will be created in the project directory.
